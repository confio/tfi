# TerraSwap Factory Contract
The factory contract can perform creation of terraswap pair contract and also be used as directory contract for all pairs.

## Handlers
### Initialize
Register verified pair contract and token contract for pair contract creation. The sender will be the owner of the factory contract. 

```rust
{
    /// Pair contract code ID, which is used to
    pub pair_code_id: u64,
    pub token_code_id: u64,
    pub init_hook: Option<InitHook>,
}
```

### UpdateConfig
    
The factory contract owner can change relevant code IDs for future pair contract creation.

```json
{
    "update_config": 
    {
        "owner": Option<HumanAddr>,
        "pair_code_id": Option<u64>,
        "token_code_id": Option<u64>,
    }
}
```

### Create Pair

When a user execute `CreatePair` operation, it creates `Pair` contract and `LP(liquidity provider)` token contract. It also creates not fully initialized `PairInfo`, which will be initialized with `Register` operation from the pair contract's `InitHook`.

```json
{ "create_pair": 
    { 
        "pair_owner": "terra1~~", 
        "commission_collect": "terra1~~", 
        "lp_commission": "0.0025", 
        "owner_commission": "0.0005",
        "asset_infos": [{
            "token": {
                "contract_addr": "terra1~~",
            }
        }, {
            "native_token": {
                "denom": "uusd",
            }
        }]
    }
}
```

### Register

When a user executes `CreatePair` operation, it passes `InitHook` to `Pair` contract and `Pair` contract will invoke passed `InitHook` registering created `Pair` contract to the factory. This operation is only allowed for a pair, which is not fully initialized. 

Once a `Pair` contract invokes it, the sender address is registered as `Pair` contract address for the given asset_infos.

```json
{ "register ": 
    "asset_infos": [{
        "token": {
            "contract_addr": "terra1~~",
            }
        }, {
            "native_token": {
                "denom": "uusd",
            }
    }],
}
```
